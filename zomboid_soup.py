## README: This script is best used with a Linux x64 Zomboid Server
## This script currently opens a Zomboid servertest.ini file to serch for steam workshop mod IDs and then uses them to search the steam workshop using Beautiful Soup to retrieve the mod's last updated timestamp
## The workshop IDs and their "last updated" timestamps are appended to a list which are then exported to a CSV file

## The idea for later develipment is that this CSV file can be loaded upon a server start and then as the server is running this script can run and scrape again the latest "last update" timestamp for each mod and compaare it to the one in the list
## and then if there are discrepencies in the timestamps the server can be restarted to initiate an update of all mods
